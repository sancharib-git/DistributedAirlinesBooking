Step 2. Once the emulators are running, you can start your Spring application using Maven.
â€¢ IntelliJ: In IntelliJ, you can open the Maven tool in the sidebar and double-click on the
spring-boot:run goal under Plugins.
You can now open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to use the application.
